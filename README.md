# Tools
This script is written to run the folllowing chimera detection tools:
1- ChimeraSlayer
2- Perseus
3- VSEARCH
4- UCHIME
5- UCHIME3

# Overview

This script uses USEARCH and Mothur tools to find chimeric sequences in FASTA files. It processes input FASTA files, updates headers with size information, performs chimera detection, and aligns sequences using Mothur.


# Prerequisites

1. Make sure that Mothur and USEARCH are installed on your system.
2. Set the paths to the Mothur and USEARCH executables in the script.
3. Make sure you have the Silva database file for reference sequences.
4. Specify the path to the Silva database file in the script or provide it as a command-line argument.

#  Excute the script

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script to detect chimeric sequences in FASTA files.

# Usage Example:
## cutom path
Users can run the script with the desired paths like the following:
```
./script.sh -m /path/to/mothur -u /path/to/usearch -s /path/to/silva.fasta

```

# Review Output
Check the output files generated by the script for chimera detection results.
